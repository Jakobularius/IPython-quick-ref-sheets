It is an\r\nattempt to make several versions of the %quickref IPython magic output for ease\r\nof access.\r\n\r\nThe final goal is to have versions that include .png, .html, and .pdf formats.\r\n\r\nImage Files\r\n========================\r\n\r\n![ScreenShot](https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Basic_Help.png)\r\n![ScreenShot2](https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Magic_only.png)\r\n\r\nSVG Images\r\n========================\r\n\r\n![Alt Basic_Help.svg](https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Basic_Help.svg)\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Basic_Help.svg\">\r\n\r\n![Alt Magic_only.svg](https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Magic_only.svg)\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Magic_only.svg\">\r\n\r\nHTML Help Tables\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe HTML versions of the quick reference tables above were generated in the IPython \r\nnotebook. They render correctly in Chrome, but they to not in\r\nFirefox.  Despite this problem, for now, these HTML files could be modified by someone with\r\nmore experience to make them a good reference.\r\n\r\nPDF Files\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe pdf versions were generated by printing out the HTML rendering from within \r\nChrome.  Unfortunately, during the print process the color for the title and the \r\nheaders was removed from the pdfs.  In the future I would like to automate this conversion from within \r\nthe IPython notebook, or just Python with the aid of a HTML to pdf library.\r\n\r\nNotebook\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe IPython notebook that generated the HTML files can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/Qick_ref_with_library.ipynb). It \r\nfirst takes the quickref text and converts it to a dictionary with labels for the\r\ntitle, headings, and comment lines, as well as the multiline examples.  A copy of\r\nthe dictionary is saved as a binary pickle and can be downloaded from this git.\r\nThe notebook goes on the generate HTML representations of the quickref text.\r\n\r\nQuick Referance Text\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe text file that this work is based on was generated fromthe IPython source code.  This\r\nwas done by downloading a copy of the source code from [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/downloads) and inserting the modification \r\nthe \"modification_code.py\" code into the \"basic.py\" file.  It was inserted around line 380 to be able to \r\nadd the %quickref_file magic command.  Ideally in the future this command will generate all \r\nthe quick reference file versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Thoughts\r\n========================\r\n\r\n[Another aproach](http://ubuntuone.com/6qEHHRVcJKd53TfEEpsCW1) was taken by Thomas Kluyver in which he manually developed\r\na quick referance sheet using Scribus. It looks better than the standard table currently rendered so in the future I \r\nwould like to switch to that style.  I encourage anyone who wants to make that change, or any other improvements, to do so.\r\n\r\nThe use of the [webkit](http://www.webkit.org/) library may be a way around using Chrome to generate the png versions.\r\n\r\nThis [IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/damontallen/IPython-quick-ref-sheets/raw/master/SVG_Table_Class-lib%2520test.ipynb) contains experiemntal results building tables from SVG parts.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
