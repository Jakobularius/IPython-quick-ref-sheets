####For Ubuntu 12.04 Users.

Download these files and run:

sudo sh Quick_install.sh

It will install a bunch of packages that are often used in IPython and create
three shortcuts on your desktop.  You may want to edit the path in the IPython 
shorcuts to reflect the directory you want to store your notebooks in.  
Additionally, you will have to manually change the appearance of the icons of 
the shortcuts.  This is done by right clicking on the icon->properties->lick on 
the current icon and slect a new one.  Two have are among the files here.
